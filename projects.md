* [Betternote: an Android App by ☃](http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs160-sp13/index.php/Group:%E2%98%83). Features an infinitely zoomable canvas to create and organize ideas. Created using the [User Centered Design Cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design).
* [aBart: Android App for new Bart users](http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs160-sp13/index.php/ProgrammingAssignment3-Colin_Chang). The result of user research, contextual inquiry, and field runs. aBart aims to make newcomers feel at home with Bay Area Rapid Transit.
* [Paper: Android finger drawing application](http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs160-sp13/index.php/ProgrammingAssignment2-Colin_Chang). Supports multiple colors and pen widths. Even a "Party!" mode (What's "Party!" mode? Check out the app to find out!).
* [Operating Systems: Threading](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa12/Nachos/phase1.html)
* [Operating Systems: Multiprogramming](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa12/Nachos/phase2.html)
* [Operating Systems: Single Server Key-Value Store](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa12/phase3.html)
* [Operating Systems: Distributed Key-Value Store](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~cs162/fa12/phase4.html)
* [Database Systems: loCALee - Database Schema Design and Web Application Server Code in Ruby On Rails](https://github.com/cs186-fa12/fa12/blob/master/hw2/README.md)	
* [Database Systems: Buffer Management in PostgreSQL](https://github.com/cs186-fa12/fa12/blob/master/hw3/README.md)	
* [Database Systems: Approximate Top-K using Count-Min Sketch](https://github.com/cs186-fa12/fa12/blob/master/hw5/README.md)	
* Artificial Intelligence: Classification. Wrote three classifiers: a naive Bayes classifier, a perceptron classifier and a large-margin (MIRA) classifier. Tested classifiers on two image data sets: a set of scanned handwritten digit images and a set of face images in which edges have already been detected.
