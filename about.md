My name is Colin Chang. I am currently employed as a Computer Scientist at Adobe in Seattle, WA. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Philosophy and a minor in Computer Science in 2013. My engineering interests include Human Computer Interaction and Systems. Philosophy-wise, I'm interested in philosophy of mind, language, logic and phenomenology. 

I have many-a-hobby, including but not limited to: men's fashion, fitness, [literature](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18475261-colin), [film](http://www.icheckmovies.com/profiles/calling/), and hiking.
