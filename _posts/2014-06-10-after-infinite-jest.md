title: "After Infinite Jest"
---

You have just finished reading David Foster Wallace's _Infinite Jest_. You, like me, probably have questions. I present the resources that I have compiled over time.

[Infinite Jest on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest?ac=1). I like to start here after I finish any book. Reviews tend to have a palatable balance of insight and colloquialism.

[thehowlingfantods](http://thehowlingfantods.com/dfw/) is an oft recommended blog devoted to David Foster Wallace.

[Trade Paperbacks' Words, Words, Words: The Infinite Jest Liveblog](http://tradepaperbacks.wordpress.com/wordswordswords/) commentates the entire tome in bite-sized chunks. Included are appropriate media to back up non-obvious references in Infinite Jest and an opinionated biography that sheds light on the themes.

[A Character Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20040811014451/http://www.ilstu.edu/~tffeene/ij/characterguide.html) (The original page 404s, so this is the [wayback](http://www.waybackmachine.org/) version). It is what it sounds like.

Aaron Swartz authors [a very popular theory](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/ijend) explaining the end of Infinite Jest which is worth considering.

[Elegant Complexity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1655890.Elegant_Complexity__A_Study_of_David_Foster_Wallace_s_Infinite_Jest) is a companion guide to Infinite Jest. I have not read it myself, but it is well received by the Goodreads community.

As for related work, I unhesitatingly recommend [E unibus pluram: television and U.S. fiction](http://jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf), a critical essay written by Wallace, about entertainment in the post-modern world.

Of course, [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=infinite+jest) has interesting material on the matter.

A brief note regarding etiquette â€” research (online, not by experience) has led me to understand that prattling about Infinite Jest is considered pretentious by some, so tread considerately.

Good luck.
