title: String.prototype.indexOf and _.indexOf
---

Today I was surprised to learn that the behavior for `_.indexOf` is not equivalent to `indexOf` on Strings. 

{% highlight javascript %}
> _.indexOf("abc", "bc")
< -1
> "abc".indexOf("bc")
< 1
{% endhighlight %}
What? 

Before I explain, let's note that there are two distinct `indexOf` functions, one for [Strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf) and one for [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf). Interestingly, the two have differing browser support for IE â€” `String.prototype.indexOf` has [IE6+ support](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/53xtt423(v=vs.94).aspx) while `Array.prototype.indexOf` has [IE9+ support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf#Browser_compatibility).

[`_.indexOf`](http://underscorejs.org/#indexOf) is for arrays. Note that it is under the "Array" heading and the documentation suggests that it takes an array, not a string. Unfortunately, the intent of _.indexOf is obfuscated when stumbling upon its usage in a codebase.

Of course, this subtlety is more misleading if you were to think "Strings are just arrays of characters!" and not appreciate the differences in implementation of the `String.prototype.indexOf` and `Array.prototype.indexOf`. String's `indexOf` performs substring operations while Array's cannot.

To illustrate the point, consider the differences between `"abc".indexOf("bc")` and `["a","b","c"].indexOf(["b", "c"])`. The former returns `1` and the latter `-1`. 

Reading the [`_.indexOf`'s implementation](http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-59) we can walk through what happens when we try to run `_.indexOf("abc", "bc")`. Underscore first attempts to delegate to `Array.prototype.indexOf`, which fails because `"abc".indexOf === String.prototype.indexOf !=== Array.prototype.indexOf`. Next, Underscore.js loops through the string, one character at a time, and compares it and the item. 

{% highlight javascript %}
"a" !== "ab"
"b" !== "ab"
"c" !== "ab"
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we return `false`.

Confusingly, `_.indexOf` actually works for strings iff the item is a single character (e.g. `_.indexOf("abc", "c")` returns `2`).

Lessons learned: If you use `_.indexOf`, please know that it is only intended for usage when `Array.prototype.indexOf` on the parameters is appropriate. If you want Array.prototype.indexOf for pre-IE9 browsers and you also have Underscore.js, use `_.indexOf`. If you need to do substring operation, use `String.prototype.indexOf`.
