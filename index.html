My name is Colin Chang. I am currently employed as a Computer Scientist at Adobe in New York, NY. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Philosophy and a minor in Computer Science in 2013. My engineering interests include Human Computer Interaction and Systems. Philosophy-wise, I'm interested in philosophy of mind, language, logic and phenomenology.
